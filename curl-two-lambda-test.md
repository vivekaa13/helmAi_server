# Complete Two-Lambda Cancellation Flow - Curl Commands

## Main Test Sequence

### Step 1: Request Flight Cancellation
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "I want to cancel my flight",
  "userId": "USER001"
}'
```

**Expected Response:**
- Intent: `flight_cancellation`
- Asks for confirmation number

### Step 2: Provide Confirmation Number (Triggers Both Lambdas)
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "My confirmation number is ABC123",
  "userId": "USER001"
}'
```

**What Happens:**
1. üîç Detects confirmation number pattern
2. üìû Calls Lambda 1: Get trips for USER001
3. üìã Extracts bookingId from earliest trip
4. üóëÔ∏è Calls Lambda 2: Cancel booking with bookingId
5. ‚úÖ Returns success confirmation with flight details

## Alternative Test Scenarios

### Test Different Users
```bash
# User 002
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "I want to cancel my flight", "userId": "USER002"}'

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "My confirmation code is XYZ789", "userId": "USER002"}'
```

### Test Different Confirmation Number Formats
```bash
# Alphanumeric pattern
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "F8FSL2", "userId": "USER001"}'

# With "booking reference"
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "My booking reference is DEF456", "userId": "USER001"}'

# 6-digit number
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "123456", "userId": "USER001"}'
```

## Expected Response Structure

### Step 1 Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "intent": "flight_cancellation",
  "userId": "USER001",
  "responseText": "I can help you cancel your flight. Please provide your confirmation number so I can locate your booking.",
  "screenAction": {
    "navigateTo": "TripsScreen",
    "showSection": "confirmation_input"
  },
  "data": {},
  "nextStep": {
    "expectedInput": "confirmation_number",
    "prompt": "Please say your confirmation number"
  }
}
```

### Step 2 Response (After Both Lambda Calls):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "intent": "booking_cancellation_confirmed",
  "userId": "USER001",
  "responseText": "Your flight AA7891 from CDG ‚Üí LGW scheduled for Sep 01, 2025 with confirmation number F8FSL2 has been successfully cancelled. A refund will be processed within 3-5 business days.",
  "screenAction": {
    "navigateTo": "TripsScreen",
    "showSection": "cancellation_confirmation"
  },
  "data": {
    "cancelledFlight": {
      "confirmationNumber": "F8FSL2",
      "route": "CDG ‚Üí LGW",
      "date": "Sep 01, 2025",
      "flight": "AA7891",
      "totalAmount": 480,
      "refundAmount": 480,
      "refundTimeline": "3-5 business days"
    }
  },
  "nextStep": {
    "expectedInput": "cancellation_complete",
    "prompt": "Your booking has been cancelled. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
  }
}
```

## Debug & Server Status

### Check Server Status
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

### Test Without Cancellation Intent (Should Not Trigger Lambdas)
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/voice/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "ABC123", "userId": "USER004"}'
```

## Server Logs to Watch For

When running the cancellation flow, watch the server terminal for:
```
üîç User USER001 provided confirmation number for cancellation
üìû Calling Lambda API for user: USER001
üìä Received X upcoming trips from Lambda
üìã Found booking to cancel: booking_1755854985068_h9zkbht - F8FSL2
üóëÔ∏è Calling cancellation Lambda for bookingId: booking_1755854985068_h9zkbht
‚úÖ Cancellation Lambda response: [response data]
üéâ Booking successfully cancelled: F8FSL2
‚úÖ Booking cancelled successfully: F8FSL2 - CDG ‚Üí LGW
```
